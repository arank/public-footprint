# Footprint Application

Build with SMS Two-Factor Authentication (SMS-2FA) helps keep your user accounts secure by validating two "factors" of identity. Most login systems only validate a password known by the user. You can make it harder for evildoers to compromise a user account by also validating something a user has, such as their mobile phone.
